Problem: Valid Credit Card Number Generator



Description: You need to write a function that generates valid credit card numbers for testing purposes. The generated numbers should pass the Luhn algorithm check, which is used to validate credit card numbers.

Requirements:

The function should generate a credit card number with a specified length (typically 16 digits).
The generated number should start with a specific digit or set of digits (known as the Bank Identification Number or BIN).
The function should ensure the generated number passes the Luhn algorithm check.
Input:
An integer length representing the total length of the credit card number (e.g., 16).
A string bin representing the starting digits of the credit card number (e.g., “4” for Visa cards).
Output:

A string representing a valid credit card number.





Steps of the Luhn Algorithm:
Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit), move left and double the value of every second digit.
If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from the result.
Sum all the digits.
This includes the digits that were doubled (and possibly adjusted) and the digits that were not doubled.
If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0, then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula.
Otherwise, the number is not valid.
Example:
Let’s validate the credit card number 4539 1488 0343 6467:

Double every second digit from the right:
Original: 4 5 3 9 1 4 8 8 0 3 4 3 6 4 6 7
Doubled: 8 5 6 9 2 4 16 8 0 3 8 3 12 4 12 7
Subtract 9 from numbers over 9:
Adjusted: 8 5 6 9 2 4 7 8 0 3 8 3 3 4 3 7
Sum all the digits:
Sum: 8 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 0 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 7 = 80
Check if the total modulo 10 is 0:
80 % 10 = 0


BIN Conversion: Convert the BIN to a list of integers.
Generate Digits: Randomly generate digits to fill the card number up to the desired length minus one.
Luhn Check Digit: Calculate the check digit using the Luhn algorithm and append it to the card number.
